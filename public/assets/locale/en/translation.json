Indeed, unless we're talking about a country cottage, nobody would think of building a house without drawings.</p><p>At the same time, clients of mobile and web application development often overlook such an important stage as planning. This leads to conflicts with developers, mismatched expectations, and, as a result, project failure, wasted money, and time.</p><p>Let us tell you how we manage to create great mobile and web applications.</p>",
    "ul-1": "<li>Working with any order at UserTech starts with the development of a technical specification, which is a mandatory stage. The development of a technical specification takes approximately 100 working hours of the team.</li><li>In the created technical specification, we provide a cost and timeline calculation for the project and send it for approval. Once the client approves them, we start the development process.</li><li>The development is usually divided into 3-4 stages, with clear indicators of product readiness. Payments can also be divided into stages.</li><li>We work according to the Agile methodology with sprint durations of 1 week. Typically, within a week, there is an update of the working version of the product, which our clients can observe in real-time. The creation of the initial working version can take 3-4 sprints from the start.</li><li>Once the project is developed and delivered, we provide paid technical support and maintenance for an unlimited period of time.</li>",
    "h3": "Technical Specification for Project Development",
    "p-2": "Just as you cannot build a good house without a project and drawings, you cannot develop a good application without a detailed description. The project concept (also known as a technical specification or design document in mobile games) is what we start with when working with each client. Without a technical specification, it is impossible to accurately estimate the cost and timeline of the project.",
    "h4-1": "What is a Technical Specification?",
    "p-3": "A technical specification is a document that provides a detailed description of the future product from different perspectives: conceptual, usability, and use cases. In the created technical specification, our company's specialists often include screen diagrams of the future application, which facilitates understanding.",
    "h4-2": "What tasks does a Technical Specification solve?",
    "ul-2": "<li>The technical specification allows for detailed project planning, working out all the nuances that can significantly affect the cost and timeline. These are the aspects that interest the client the most.</li><li>It synchronizes the understanding of the project between the client and the developer. Often, this understanding can differ significantly and without a well-developed technical specification, it can lead to conflicts.</li><li>It defines ways to solve complex aspects of the project.</li>",
    "p-4": "Our company provides technical specification development services performed by highly qualified specialists with experience in various fields. They can see optimal solutions where others cannot.",
    "h4-3": "What does a Technical Specification consist of?",
    "p-5": "Each technical specification has its own structure, but in general, the main sections can be outlined as follows:",
    "ol": "<li>Project Description: A simple explanation of the product or service being developed, its purpose, and how it works.</li><li>Component Structure: The components that will be included in the product: backend, frontend, mobile; how they will interact with each other.</li><li>  Technological Stack: The programming languages to be used, technical requirements for the software.</li><li>Use Cases: Usage scenarios of the application by users. This section may also include screen maps and mock-ups of key screens.</li><li>Security and Fault Tolerance: How protection against hacking will be implemented, as well as resistance to load and scalability.</li>",
    "p-6": "On average, a technical specification takes 20-40 A4 pages. At the end of it, our company's specialists provide a cost and timeline calculation for project completion.",
    "h4-4": "How is a Technical Specification created?",
    "p-7": "<p>UserTech assigns a project manager to the client, who engages in dialogue to clarify the details of the desired application and proposes various solutions. If necessary, they may involve more specialized experts in the development of the technical specification, not only from a technical but also from a legal perspective.</p><p>The document is prepared in Google Docs, and we immediately provide access to it. This way, the client can monitor the document's preparation in real-time, make corrections or suggestions.</p>"
